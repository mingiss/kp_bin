       Mo'Slo lets you to slow the speed of your computer to 1-99% of normal
       in 1% increments. To use it, you supply the name of the program you
       want to run slow as a command line argument. Slowness is adjusted with
       a command line switch. If the switch is not supplied, Mo'Slo slows your
       computer to approximate a 4.77MHz PC/XT.


       INSTALLATION

       To install Mo'Slo, simply copy moslo.com into a directory that is
       accessible through your system path variable. To find out which
       directories are in your path, simply enter the word 'path' at the DOS
       command prompt.

       In DOS 6.22 and earlier, C:\DOS is almost always in your path.
       In DOS 7 (Win95), C:\WINDOWS\COMMAND is a good choice.


       OPERATION

       Mo'Slo is a program that runs your programs. You execute Mo'Slo with
       slowdown speed and your program's name as command line arguments.
       Mo'Slo then slows your computer and executes your program.

       Mo'Slo v.1.32 requires the complete filename of your program, plus any
       path required to find it. For example, if the default directly at the
       command line is the root directory C:\, and your game 'game.com' is in
       a subdirectory 'mygames', the following command entered at the DOS
       prompt will run 'game.com' at 20% normal speed:

               moslo /20 c:\mygames\game.com

       Since many games use other files to keep high scores, bitmaps, etc.,
       it's best to switch to the drive and directory in which the game is
       located before running it. For example, if the program you want to run
       is located on drive D: in the subdirectory 'mygames', and the default
       directory is currently the root of C:, then you would first switch to
       drive D:, then change to the '\mygames' directory, then run Mo'Slo.
       Example command sequence:

               d:
               cd \mygames
               moslo /20 game.com

       When you exit your program in the normal fashion, you also exit Mo'Slo
       and normal speed is restored. Mo'Slo doesn't stay resident in memory
       and it doesn't alter the system clock.

       Mo'Slo v.1.32 will not run batch (.BAT) files. To run a batch
       file, you must either (1) alter the line in the batch file that
       calls the executable program, (2) use Mo'Slo to launch COMMAND.COM,
       then launch your program with a separate command, e.g.

               moslo /n c:\command.com
               game.com

       After you exit your game you must then enter "exit" on the command
       line to restore normal speed.

       or (3) the simplest solution: purchase Mo'Slo Deluxe (see below).

       TIPS

       Using Mo'Slo in a DOS box in MS Windows or Win95 -- even at full
       screen -- can result in jerky operation. For best results, exit to
       the DOS command line.

       It is best to start fast and work downward until you find a good
       slowdown speed. If you try to run Mo'Slo too slow, your computer may
       actually speed up to normal speed and it will look as though Mo'Slo
       is not working at all. A good strategy is to start at 50%. If 50% is
       too fast, try 25%. If 25% is too slow, try 35%, etc. Narrow down by
       trying a midpoint between the too-fast speed and the too-slow speed
       until you reach an optimum. Then make note of what percentage works
       best with each program that you need to slow.

       Running Mo'Slo without any argument displays instructions.

       When running on Pentium computers, there may be a few seconds delay
       when starting your application and when exiting to DOS.


       *********************************************************************

       MO'SLO DELUXE is an enhanced version of Mo'Slo that allows slowdown
       percentages from 0.1 to 99.9%, making it possible to run even the
       oldest PC games and timing-sensitive programs on a fast Pentium PC.
       Mo'Slo Deluxe also runs batch files transparently to the user, and
       does not require you to enter the file extension of executables or
       batch files. Includes a pause mode that allows changing speed percent
       without exiting your program, and a quick-start option for loading
       programs at full speed with slowdown after load.
