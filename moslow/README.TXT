

    The Mo'Slo v.1.32b evaluation package should contain four files: this
    file, MOSLO132.TXT, MOSLO132.WRI, and MOSLO.COM.

    Before installing Mo'Slo v.1.32, please print and read MOSLO132.TXT
    or MOSLO132.WRI.

    MOSLO132.WRI is for Windows users and may be read and printed from
    MS WRITE, MS WORDPAD, or MS WORD.

    MOSLO132.TXT may be printed on a non-PostScript printer using the
    DOS COPY command -- turn on your printer and enter the following
    DOS command line, substituting the correct drive and path for
    'd:\path\' (you may also need to substitute 'LPT1' or 'LPT2' for
    'PRN', depending on how many printers you have):

           COPY d:\path\MOSLO132.TXT PRN:

    You may view and/or print MOSLO132.TXT from within a text editor,
    but since the file is pre-formatted you must set your printer's
    margins to '0' in order to get a legible printed copy.

    Mo'Slo v.1.32 is intended as a 'preview' of the basic functionality
    of Mo'Slo Deluxe. Mo'Slo Deluxe includes many features not found in
    v.1.32, including speed adjustment in 0.1% increments, speed adjustment
    while running, 'quick load' (slow after load), and the capability to
    run batch files. For more info, visit our WWW site:
